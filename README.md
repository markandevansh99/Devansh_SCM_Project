# Devansh_SCM_Project
This is Source Code Management Project

Good Afternoon to all my collaborators.
My Collaborators Include Anurag Mor, Aman Kumar Gupta and Animesh Jain.

My project is based on MENU DRIVEN PROGRAM ON IMPLEMENTATIONS OF STACK AND QUEUE USING LINKED LIST and along with that SINGLY LINKED LIST, 
DOUBLY LINKED LIST AND CIRCULAR QUEUE.

Now, Below is the MENU WHICH WILL BE THE MAIN BASE OF THIS PROJECT :-

**********MAIN MENU******************
 1. SINGLY LINKED LIST OPERATIONS";
 2. CIRCULAR LINKED LIST OPERATIONS
 3. QUEUE OPERATIONS USING LINKED LIST
 4. STACK OPERATIONS USING LINKED LIST
 5. DOUBLY LINKED LIST OPERATIONS
 6. STACK OPERATIONS USING ARRAY
 7. QUEUE OPERATIONS USING ARRAY


AS THE MANAGER, I will be contributing in code by creating main() with switch-case operation and by Implementing Singly Linked Lists Operations.

All my collaborators will take up the following implemetations:-
ANURAG MOR - Circular Queue Operations
             Queue using Linked List
          
Aman Kumar Gupta - Stack using Linked List
                    Doubly Linked List operations
                    
Animesh Jain - Stack Using Array
               Queue using Array
               
This project will be implemented by Branching Strategy.
Every collaborator will create his own branch and work into that branch only and will push the file by their Branch.
After All the three branches are pushed, the collaborators will send me a pull request and I will review their code and will merge it with my master if It is bugfree.



Now, all the Branches namely :-

mor,aman and Animesh_Test 

are pushed respectively from their branches and now the collaborators will send me pull request and I will review it and then accept and merge the branches into the master.


                                                 MERGING
                                                 
 1. I have accepted the pull request from Anurag Mor and I have merged it from the Master Branch as the code was very well written with proper intendation as well.
 
 2. I have accepted the pull request from Aman Gupta and I have merged his branch (aman) from the master branch as his code helped me in making my program even more updated and gave it a better shape.
